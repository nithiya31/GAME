# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java. The game allows a human player to play against an AI player in a 3x3 grid.

## Features

- Human vs. AI gameplay.
- The board is displayed after each turn.
- The game checks for row, column, and diagonal wins.
- It also checks for a draw when all cells are filled.
- The human player is prompted to enter the row and column for their move.
- AI randomly selects valid moves.

## How to Play

1. The human player (Nithiya) will play as `'X'` and the AI will play as `'O'`.
2. Players take turns to place their marks on the 3x3 grid.
3. The player who manages to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
4. If the board is completely filled and no player has aligned three marks, the game ends in a draw.
